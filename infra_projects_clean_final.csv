Over time, the pond will accumulate sediment which will reduce the permanent storage, impacting the sediment removal efficiency of the pond drastically, resulting in untreated water being released to the Creek. The Town of Whitby conducted a ponds need study in 2011 to evaluate the pond permanent storage capacity. A bathymetric survey revealed that a fair amount of sediment had accumulated in the ponds and a majority of the ponds require cleanout. Under this project accumulated sediment in the pond will be removed allowing for the required permanent storage in the pond. The resulting pond will perform to its design efficiency which will improve the quality of the runoff released to the creeks.

108,Lachine Train Maintenance Centre AMT,"Opportunity
The Agence métropolitaine de transport de Montréal (AMT) relied on two train operators, CN and CP, for train parking and rolling stock maintenance. The situation was no longer optimal—AMT’s commuter train ridership has more than doubled in 15 years of operations and its fleet of trains had grown from 217 trains in 2011 to more than 300 in 2015.
AMT seized on the opportunity to construct a self-sufficient maintenance centre in Lachine for rolling stock running on CP rails as the Government of Québec continued to invest in public transit in the Greater Montréal Area in order to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
In February 2011 the federal government announced its support for the project with a P3 Canada Fund contribution of $25 million.
Results

Located on a 13-hectare site directly connected to Lucien-L’Allier station, the terminating station for the Vaudreuil-Hudsn lines, the Lachine Train Maintenance Centre includes:
	
Parking or 13 trains in an exterior garage;
An inspection shop for a full ten-car train and one locomotive;
A major repair shop for two locomotives and two cars;
A high-pressure deep cleaning station; and
An automated train wash.


The facility is instrumental in the timely maintenance and future development of commuter trains. During the daytime, between morning and afternoon rush hours, the trains will be parked in readiness for the evening rush, where the AMT will conduct inspections, scheduled maintenance and minor repairs.",Canada,Quebec,Montréal,CAD,119000000.0,107764377.0,"Automotive, Car Parking, Commercial, Government, Rail, Residential",Unknown,True,False,Unknown,2014-01-01,extracted_timestamp,P3SPECTRUM,http://www.p3spectrum.ca/project/info/?id=173,0

135,Regional Express Rail - Stouffville Corridor,"Opportunity
Announced by the Government of Ontario in 2014, Regional Express Rail (RER) will transform the public transit system in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area over the next decade. RER will transform the GO rail network, bringing 15-minute, two-way, all-day electrified GO service to communities across the region. In order to implement RER system-wide infrastructure upgrades will be necessary including additional tracks, expanded stations, electrification of the rail network, new locomotives and new train control systems.
Infrastructure upgrades will be required at three GO Stations on the Stouffville corridor, as well as a new grade separation at Steeles Avenue along the rail corridor, in order to support RER.

Results

The project involved infrastructure upgrades for three GO Stations including:
	
Milliken Station: new and relocated platforms with canopy enclosure, tunnels, elevators, Steeles Avenue pedestrian connection, and customer amentities;
Agincourt Station: new second track, new and relocated platforms with canopy enclosure, tunnels, elevators, customer waiting areas, building relocation, and customer amenities provisions; and
Unionville Station: new second track and turning track, new and relocated platforms with canopy enclosure, tunnels, elevators, parking expansion and customer amenities.


RER has a significant social, economic and green benefits for residents of the GTHA including:
	
reduced traffic congestion—which is currently estimated to cost up to $11 billion;
reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption;
improved the quality of life for commuters by significantly reducing daily travel times;
improved access to employment, education and other community activities; and

220,Royal Jubilee Hospital Patient Care Centre,"Opportunity
The Royal Jubilee Hospital (RJH) is one of two tertiary hospitals servicing Vancouver Island. It provides high-level trauma care and specialized services for approximately 752,000 residents within the Vancouver Island Health Authority area.
The Diagnostic Treatment Centre at RJH opened in 2002, significantly upgrading the hospital’s diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, the average age of RJH buildings is 55 years—the oldest of which are the East and South block, dating back 85 years. Health concerns included mold, asbestos, and plumbing problems.
In November 2005, the Vancouver Island Health Authority identified construction of a new Patient Care Centre at the hospital as a top priority in its five-year strategic plan. While the Patient Care Centre was procured using a P3, additional project elements required to support the facility, such as upgrades to the power plant, were procured using traditional procurement between 2007 and 2012.
Challenges

The hospital buildings on RJH campus housing patient bedrooms are vulnerable to seismic events, with existing structures only meeting approximately 20 per cent of building code requirements. Therefore, the new patient care centre was to be built to adapt to post-disaster scenarios.

Innovations

Transferring risk to the private partner meant taxpayers weren't on the hook for cost overruns.
The project agreement includes lifecycle maintenance, meaning the private partner is responsible and accountable for ensuring the facility is maintained and rehabilitated or else face financial penalties for non-compliance.

Results

The 500-bed, 37,000-square-metre Royal Jubilee Hospital Patient Care Centre, comprised of 83 per cent single rooms, provides inpatient services to medical/surgical patients and patients suffering from mental health and addictions issues.
The facility modernizes and centralizes inpatient accommodation, replacing services that were dispersed across seven different buildings on the Royal Jubilee Hospital campus.
It is directly connected to the existing Diagnostic and Treatment Centre and is expected to yield benefits in three broad areas  by creating:
	
A centre of excellence in elder care—it is the world’s first acute care facility designed entirely for the elderly;
A ‘magnet’ workplace,  attracting, retaining and training high quality staff; and
A sustainable solution with a small footprint on the environment throughout all phases of the agreement.


The design ensures a clear separation of patient, visitor, and service flows while incorporating therapy and support services within each floor; inboard bathrooms allowing staff to respond to and provide assistance to patients quickly;, line-of-sight from halls to patients’ heads to facilitate easier observation by care staff; and a compact unit layout decreasing walking distances for staff.
The project is one of the first hospitals in Canada to attain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification.

“The ability to achieve the first elder-friendly, the first Pacific Green environmentally friendly and a magnet for hospital staff is amazing. And the opportunity to share tis with other healthcare providers across the world is exceptional. Al of this in a project that achieves several firsts both clinically and environmentally is truly a project to be proud to participate in.”
- Denise Blade, General Manager, ISL Health.

The north-east segment of the Anthony Henday Drive was completed by October 2016. Credit: Government of Alberta. The sod-turning ceremony on the final segment of Anthony Henday Drive was held in July 2012. Credit: Government of Alberta. Edmonton Ring Road, also referred to as Anthony Henday Drive (named after the first explorer of north-west Canada), is a highway encircling the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The 78km road opened to traffic in October 2016. The 27km-long final segment of the project was constructed as part of a 34-year public-private-partnership (P3) contract signed in 2012 between the Alberta Government and Capital City Link Group. The proposals to build a ring road around Edmonton date back to the 1970s. Land for the project was purchased under the Transportation and Utility Corridor programme. These proposals were taken into consideration in March 2004 with the commencement of planning on the south-east leg of the ring road. It was the first P3 project in Alberta. The whole ring road is divided into four sections, namely Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest. The 24km-long south-west section of the ring road was completed by October 2006, which stretches between Highway 2 and Highway 14, and includes 20 bridges and five interchanges. It also includes a six-lane road between Highway 2 and 50th Street and is a four-lane highway between 50th Street and Highway 14, which was completed in October 2007. A consortium of Access Roads Edmonton acted as the design, build and operating contractor for the segment. Funding for the segment was extended by Macquarie Essential Assets Partnership (MEAP). The north-west segment of the ring road stretches 21km between Yellowhead Trail and Manning Drive Freeway. Tenders for the project were issued in July 2007 and it was built under P3. Land acquisition for the segment’s construction, which includes five flyovers, eight interchanges, 27 bridge structures and no traffic signals, was completed by August 2007. In July 2008, NORTHWESTCONNECT General Partnership was selected as the preferred bidder amongst three groups qualified with a bid price of $1.42bn. Construction of the segment was completed in November 2011. Capital City Link Group won the bid for the construction of the north-east segment of the ring road in May 2011. Financial closure was achieved in May 2012 and the contract was valued at $1.81bn. The P3 model helped to complete the construction three years earlier than the conventional method. The sod-turning ceremony of this 27km final segment of the ring road was held in July 2012. Construction on the final leg of the ring road includes reconstruction of 18km of six and eight-lane freeway, and construction of 9km of new six and eight-lane freeway, eight interchanges, seven grade separations, nine flyovers and 46 bridges, including twin river bridges. The entire road was constructed in five sections. Construction work on section 1 was carried out between July 2012 and June 2016, section 2 between November 2012 and May 2015, sections 3 and 4 was constructed between August 2012 and September 2016, while section 5 from October 2012 to November 2015. Construction on the whole stretch was completed by October 2016. Capital City Link Group, a consortium of Meridiam Infrastructure NEAH ULC, ACS NEAH Partner, and HOCHTIEF NEAH Partner, is the main contractor for designing, constructing, financing, maintaining and operating the north-east section of the ring road. A joint venture (JV) between Flatiron Constructors Canada, Dragados Canada, Aecon Construction Management and Lafarge Canada was subcontracted for the design and construction of the project. HOCHTIEF PPP Solutions North America, ACS Infrastructure Canada, and MNII Canada I are the project leads. Financing for the project was managed by ACS Infrastructure Canada.
